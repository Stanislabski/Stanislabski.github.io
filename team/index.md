# {% include icon.html icon="fa-solid fa-users" %}Team

Our team is united by a shared interest in understanding how molecular and microbial data can be used to improve human health. We bring together diverse backgrounds in epidemiology, statistics, computational biology, and biomedical sciences to ask interdisciplinary questions and develop meaningful solutions.

We value inclusion, curiosity, and collaboration. We believe that a supportive and respectful environment helps everyone thrive, and we are committed to fostering a lab culture where each person’s contributions and experiences are valued.

Our team includes postdocs, graduate students, staff scientists, and collaborators from a range of institutions and disciplines.
