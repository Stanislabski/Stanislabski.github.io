We develop tools and resources that support our mission to understand how the microbiome and other omic pathways—such as genetics, metabolomics, and epigenetics—influence the response to clinical interventions like diet and exercise. Our projects often emerge from collaborations with clinical studies and large cohort datasets, allowing us to explore diverse populations and generate insights into cardiometabolic health.

Our lab is especially focused on building reproducible, open-source software and statistical workflows that enable the analysis of complex biological data and help advance precision nutrition and personalized health strategies. Below are some of our featured tools and datasets.
